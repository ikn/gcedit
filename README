    INSTALLATION

There is no installation method on Windows.  On Unix-like OSs, with GNU make or
equivalent, run

    ./configure
    make
    make install

The makefile respects the prefix, DESTDIR, etc. arguments.  Of course,
`make install' needs to be run as root if installing outside of your home
directory.  To uninstall, run

    make uninstall

`make clean' and `make distclean' are also supported, and work as expected.

    USAGE

On Windows, in the source directory, run

    python run_gcedit

where python is the Python 3 interpreter.

On Unix-like OSs, once installed, just run gcedit (installed to /usr/local/bin/
by default).  Alternatively, you can run in-place without installing by

    ./configure
    ./run_gcedit
